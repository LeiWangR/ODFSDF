The authors of NIPS2016 paper process the sound waves in the raw. The only-processing they did on the videos was to convert sound to MP3s, reduce the sampling rate to 22 kHz, and convert to single channel audio.

They also scale the waveform to be in the range [-256. 256]. The did not need to substract the mean because it was naturally near zero already.
